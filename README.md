## Overview

The Interactive Learning App is a web and mobile application designed to enhance learning through interactive modules such as quizzes, flashcards, and other engaging activities related to book content. The app supports user authentication and content management, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (Web), React Native (Mobile), Kotlin (Mobile)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Features

### Frontend

1. **User Interface Design**
   - Implement a user-friendly interface for interactive learning modules.
   - Create components for quizzes, flashcards, and other activities.

2. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
   - Create protected routes accessible only by authenticated users.

3. **State Management**
   - Manage user authentication state using React Context API or Redux.
   - Handle loading states, error states, and user feedback for authentication actions.

4. **Routing**
   - Set up client-side routing for different app sections (e.g., home, quizzes, flashcards, user profile).
   - Ensure protected routes are only accessible to authenticated users.

5. **Integration with Backend**
   - Use Axios or Fetch API to communicate with backend endpoints for authentication and interactive content.
   - Handle token storage and expiration (e.g., storing JWT in localStorage or cookies).

6. **Content Management**
   - Create pages and components for displaying and managing quizzes, flashcards, and other activities.
   - Implement forms for creating and updating content (accessible to authorized users).

### Backend

7. **User Model**
   - Create a user schema with fields for username, email, password, and roles.
   - Implement password hashing for secure password storage.

8. **Authentication**
   - Set up JWT-based authentication for stateless user sessions.
   - Implement registration, login, and token verification endpoints.
   - Use middleware to protect routes that require authentication.

9. **API Endpoints**
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for managing quizzes, flashcards, and other content.
   - Implement CRUD operations for interactive learning content.
   - Ensure endpoints are protected and only accessible to authenticated users (with appropriate roles).

10. **Content Management**
    - Define schemas and models for quizzes, flashcards, and other activities.
    - Implement validation for incoming data to ensure integrity and security.
